# The-Job-Application
Another project I was involved in, doing some changes/adding new functions to our job application that we use to hire photographers.

I created desired working area where you choose which county you would like to work in, the checkbox questions, the database fields and the overview of the applicants in Filemaker.

Technology used: SQL,  Service stack (ASP.NET), HTML, CSS, Filemaker.


Following Images represent required fields applicants were forced to fill in order to apply for work.

Overview of the applicants once they have been fetched into Filemaker. In this view we can sort by different values, where the default is sorted by latest applicant.
